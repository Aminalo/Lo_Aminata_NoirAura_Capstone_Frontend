# NoirAura (Capstone) — Lo_Aminata_Noiraura_Capstone

## Overview

NoirAura is a full-stack web application designed to connect clients with beauty professionals in a modern, elegant, and seamless way.
The platform allows users to discover salons, makeup artists, hairstylists, and skincare experts, explore their services, view portfolios, and book appointments directly online — all within an intuitive, responsive interface.

Built with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, NoirAura merges technology with beauty to create a personalized self-care experience inspired by luxury and empowerment.

## Inspiration & Name Meaning

The name NoirAura blends two powerful ideas:

“Noir” — French for black, symbolizing elegance, strength, and cultural pride. It reflects Aminata’s roots and her fashion brand Noirceur, which celebrates African beauty and sophistication.

“Aura” — representing the inner glow and unique energy that radiates from confidence and self-care.

Together, they mean “The elegant glow of identity.” NoirAura isn’t just an app — it’s a statement that beauty and confidence are forms of power.
